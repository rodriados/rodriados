I was invited to give a talk about my profession and my daily routine as a software
development engineer. Everything's alright, the only problem is that the talk will
have to be in Spanish, which is the language I think I feel the least comfortable
with. Nonetheless, I do not usually say no to such things and challenges. I decided
that I am going to talk about Git. For a long time I wanted to talk about it doing
an analogy with physics, or time-travel. I do not know whether it will work out
interesting, but that's where I am going.
