My brothers had their 21st birthday this month. This is curious, because I can remember
very well where I was and what I was doing on my 21st birthday. That allowed me,
for the first time in my life, realize how much older than my brothers I am. My
21st birthday was very memorable, as I was still living in the USA, and that day
I went skiing with some friends, for the first and only time of my life. Though
my skiing prowess were not very impressive, it was enough for me to see how long
of a timespan 7 years is. That's definitely a curious feeling.
