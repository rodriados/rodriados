I have been really invested on learning about economy and investiments. I honestly
find it all very interesting, so much as to fathom whether it would be valuable
for me to get a certificate in the area and/or work on the field. I've been cooking
ideas on my mind about developing a complete system and website where the retail
investor can satisfy all their needs without needing to check out any other sources.
Though I do think it would interesting, I reckon it's a lot of work to execute everything
I have in mind. Maybe I should try focusing first on my personal pains, and then
evolving into something more and more complete.
