Last thursday, unfortunately, was the day my grandfather passed away. He's had a
long life and has left me a lot of pride of the man he has been. Although I did
not want him to pass away, I think his goal on this Earth has been successfully
completed during his 86 years of life. I could not get sad, his last days were quite
suffering... It's really difficult to see someone you love in a hospital bed, almost
unable to move, to talk or do anything whatsoever. Nonetheless, besides his always
complicated medical conditions, he has talked and walked and done everything in
his own until the last day he had to go to the hospital. I might have never really
given too much attention to him, or listened to what he had to say to me, but I
glad I have never disrepected him and have always tried to be with him and talk
to him whenever I had the chance. It is sad, but it is the cycle of everyone's lives.
I can only thank the opportunity to meet my grandfather and have him for 28 years
of my life.
