As I might have said in 2021, I love watching the Olympic Games. These last two
weeks I have been watching everyday, almost all day long, the Pan-American Games.
This is like a mini-Olympic Games only for countries within the american continent.
I remember to watch Rio 2007 Pan-American games, I have to this day in my mind some
scenes from that event that really fascinated me. These events have some kind of
mystic behind them, maybe it's their scarcity: they come and go only for two weeks
every four years. I'm already looking forward to the Olympic Games in 2024. At least
now I've lived enough not to feel sad anymore when the Games are over.
