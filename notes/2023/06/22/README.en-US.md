This week, the whole world's been talking about a submersive that's disappeared
in the deep waters around the Titanic shipwreck. Honestly, I cannot understand why
someone would pay $250K to be cramped inside a small precarious submarine to see
something in the bottom of ocean through a miniscule window. These people have known
about the risks of this adventure beforehand, and they've anyway insisted on going
on this trip. Unfortunately, things didn't work out and the ship's imploded under
water. At least, they've had apparently no time to realize what was happening. If
anything, this is the best that could happen to avoid suffering.
