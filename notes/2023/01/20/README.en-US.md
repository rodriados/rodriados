These last weeks I've been studying about the futures market. It has caught my attention
as it works totally differently than the usual stocks market and allows us to operate
with a completely different mindset. As I still am no expert - actually, I'm far
away from one -, I'm still only looking around, watching others working with it
before putting my own skin on the game. I'm becoming everyday more fascinated with
the breadth of possibilities offered to investors... and a bit scared as well.
