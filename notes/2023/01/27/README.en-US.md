Life is just too short. **We should live our best every single day.**

This week I turned 28 and I don't feel like it. I don't feel like I'm 28 already,
and there are things I thought I would already have done when I were 28 that I still
do not have. It's not that I bother much about it but sometimes I feel like time
is passing by and I am not really evolving towards what I thought I should already
have done. Once again, I do not like birthdays... Of course I am happy and grateful
for living one more year, but I wish I and my parents and relatives could never
age, never get old... Though many people say it's a privilege to get older, I still
do not like it.

One more reason for me not to like my birthday this year, is that one of the cats
that lived in our street, and that we used to care for, unfortunately passed away
the exact day of my birthday. There were two cats, one white and one black, that
used to live with our neighbor before she moved to an asylum. She moved, the cats
stayed at their home. Sadly, something's happened to the white one this week, we
are not sure exactly what, and she quickly got ill. We tried to save her, but it
was already too late... I kept thinking of her the whole week, even though she didn't
really live with us. Sometimes I think we should have done more to try to save her,
but I am sure she's now at a better place, where she finds comfort for her pain.
