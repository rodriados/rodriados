Today, after 5 years or even more, my group of friends from university and I have
gathered together once again and had lunch at the house of one of them. It is interesting
to see how each one has taken a different path in both their professional and personal
lives. Still, it makes me happy that we all keep living in the same city and can
cherish our friendship once in a while. It is way too common to friends apart themselves
when the context that united them was gone.
