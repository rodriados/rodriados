I think I have been losing my fear of doctors. Well, not really, but I think I can
understand it better nowadays. My conclusion is that I fear those specialities that
are intrusive, or that I consider to be intrusive. I mean, I still get nervous whenever
I have to see, like, an ophthalmologist or a dermatologist, for instance, but I
can somehow keep my composure and tolerate to be examined by them. Unfortunately,
I do not think that I can yet see a dentist without getting completely afraid for
my life. I wish I could somehow change it, and be able to fearlessly visit one.
