I've been feeling kind of lonely lately. I would like to find a girl that could
become my girlfriend, but I do not know where to look... Granted, I almost do not
leave home and, by not doing so, I will certainly not find anyone. The bigger problem,
though, is that I do not even know where to go. I do have some ideas, but I refuse
going to places I think I would not feel comfortable at. I have to start taking
some action, because things won't simply happen if I don't do anything...
