# The year, 2023

Another year's gone by and, in general, I think 2023 had its moments to be remembered
by in my personal life. In a broader sense, the year has brought some moments of
tension in national and even international affairs: new wars and threats of war
around the globe have been in the highlight, specially during the second semester.

Unlike the previous years, this time I have not changed jobs, and I feel happy where
I currently am. I had the opportunity to travel to Buenos Aires, Argentina and see
another country and city I hadn't seen before. In August, I have met a girl but
unfortunately, it didn't work out for us. On a sad note, it unfortunately was the
year I lost my grandfather, the last grandparent I had.

Although the wars that have ecloded during the last years seem not to be close to
an end, economically there seems to be a global change for the better. In relation
to the country I live in, 2023 seems to be an year where we have changed many good
paths of prosperity to old formulas that have already resulted bad in the past.
The effects of such choices are not immediate, thus we have to keep an eye on what
goes on after the year ends.

This was my 28th year and I, as always, thank God for all the good and the not-so-good
things that I have lived during 2023. It was an year of some memorable moments,
and I hope 2024 brings many more.
