It's quite impressive to realize the economic situation of Argentina. Although the
city of Buenos Aires has a lot of impressive buildings and is indeed very developed,
it's clear by walking on the streets that it's not easy for those who live here.
But, it looks as though the people are hopeful for a better future. The argentinians
are very welcoming and, as a country close to mine, I wish them all the best and
that future for this country is bright.
