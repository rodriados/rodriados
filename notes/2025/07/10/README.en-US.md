For the first time in years, since before the pandemic, I have worked in an office
with my work colleagues. It is a very nice experience: you feel like you're part
of the group, and you can share some time together. After work, we have gone out
for "happy hour", and ate at some restaurant. Nonetheless, I think that being at
the office makes us be less productive than when working from home. This is so because
there's always something going on and people talking around you. The day offered
me a complete view of how it would be to live there and have to go to the office
often, but I still prefer to be on my own, working from home.
