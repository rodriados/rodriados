Today is my 30th birthday. Thirtieth. I've always imagined my 30s to be so far away
in the future... Well, they now start today. Birthdays always make me look back
at everything I've done in the past year, but now, I'm looking a decade behind.
It's impressive how many experiences I have accumulated in these years and, yet,
so much time have I wasted. No regrets: there's no way we can make every single
day of our lives memorable, but we must wholeheartedly live those days that do be
forever. Ten years ago I was dreaming of the day I would go to the US for the time
I was going to study there. That time came and is now long gone. Then, I graduated,
and completed my masters degree. I have traveled and seen different countries. I
have met many people that I do maintain contact with and others that have come and
gone. There was a pandemic, that forced me to stay a year or two at home. Still,
I can only imagine everything I'll be living in the next 10 years. I hope to make
the most of it, and to have everyone that I love by my side until then.
