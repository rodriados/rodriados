The year is almost over. 2025 was an okay year but, I think, nothing very memorable.
I am glad that I did manage to achieve this year's goals. I am glad that I had the
chance to see two cities that I didn't think I would visit at the beginning of this
year. It was also the year that I travelled the most since a decade ago. I am glad
that I and all my loved ones are healthy and without any significant problems in
our lives. I know that 2026 will be a challenging year and that some things will
change in my life but, I hope it will be a good one.
