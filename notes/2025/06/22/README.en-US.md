Just some hours ago, there was a new scalation on the war that's broken on the Middle
East this month: the US has bombed Iran. It wasn't really unexpected, as the media
was talking about this for some days now. The problem, though, is that we fear that
it might become something bigger and involve many countries, which might take many
lives with it. War is never good, it is never a solution. I'm glad that I live in
country that is very far away from this and usually don't get involved in these
kinds of situations. Let's hope for the best, and pray that peace prevails in the
end. Yet, at this moment, we are definitely reprehensive.
