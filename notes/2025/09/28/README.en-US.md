This September has been full of impactful events. I think I should have written
more about everything that's happened throughout this month, but I haven't. Some
of the events have shown me - and the world, to be fair - that the most extreme
actions are tolerated by some people, and even praised. It shows that humanity has
been lost in the hearts of many. Dehumanizing people for opinions - or for any reason
actually - should be always condemned, yet many fail to do so. That saddens me.
I usually like to philosophize and come up with ideas to fix humanity's problems,
even though they might be unfeasible. But the gleeful behaviour of many in face
of such atrocities has rendered me skeptic that we, as a species, might ever work
together again to solve our greatest problems.
