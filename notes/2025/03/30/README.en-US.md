It's that time of the year that we have to do our annual taxes report. Even though
we pay a lot of taxes all year-round, it's this time that we find out that we should
pay even more! Unfortunately, there's not much we can do to avoid it, but I cannot
understand it at all, those people that say that we should pay even more! It's sad
to see that more that a third of everything that you earn by working goes away to
the government that completely wastes it all.
