# The year, 2025

I finally reached the 30s! I am very thankful to start be well and healthy during
the whole year 2025. For a long time I saw it as distant future and it is now already
in the past. Time does fly. I can only be happy to probably not have anything specially
remarkable to remember about 2025. I stayed at my current job for one more year,
but I already know that some things will change soon. I had the chance to travel
once again, being the 3rd consecutive year that I happen to go to Argentina and
the 2nd year that I go to Chile as well. I hope to continue the travelling trend
in 2026. I kept investing throughout the year and I already seem to get some results
out of it! In 2025 I have not studied German.

In general, besides my happily uneventful year, 2025 was a somewhat chaotic year.
Although some wars that began in the previous years are - apparently - solved, there
are still tensions in the world that might cause some fears in Europe and around
the globe in general. We end 2025 with some good perspectives, but nothing concrete
yet.

The year seems to end without much hopes, for the population in general, that we
might achieve good results in the elections of the coming year. The corruption scandals,
that I imagined would only be pulled under the rug in 2026, have finished the year
already forgotten. Because of this prospect, 2025 maybe seems to have had the most
unenthusiastic year ending that I can remember of.

Nonetheless, I thank God for being alive for one more year. I need to figure out
a way to spend my 30s well, as I did with my early-20s. Let 2026 show me the way.
