Recently I learned about the Gua√≠ra Falls, which were the biggest waterfalls in
water volume in the whole world! They are now submerged in between Brazil and Paraguay,
due to the construction of the Itaipu Dam in the 70s and 80s. It bothers me that
I have never heard about them before, even though I live very close, in one of the
states they were in. Apparently, they were so immense that the roar of the waterfalls
could be heard as far as 30 km away! I do understand that it was a needed construction,
that our electric grid depends a lot on it, but it makes me sad to think that such
a marvelous natural beauty cannot be seen anymore.
