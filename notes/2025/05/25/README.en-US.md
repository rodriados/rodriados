Today I have read about some interesting historical facts about my city, and places,
buildings, streets and traditions that have changed through the years. I also went
to a park - one that I've been wanting to go to for a while now. Unfortunately,
it saddens me that the city seems to not care about its history or its public spaces.
Everything seems abandoned or not cared for at all. I wish we, as a society, could
work together to make the city a more liveable space, with clean green areas and
that we valued our past.
