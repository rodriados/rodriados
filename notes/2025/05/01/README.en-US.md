After five years without personally seeing any of the work colleagues I had during
this time, today I had the opportunity of meeting - in person - the people I have
been working with in the last 2 years. We had a very nice time and had lunch together.
They are just as I thought they would be in real life. Although I don't want to
move to São Paulo, I'm thinking of coming more often so we can be together more
often as well. Unfortunately, that's no easy task, and not cheap either.
