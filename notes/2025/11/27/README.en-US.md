Well, my vacation trip is almost over but it was a great experience and many things
surprised me. When I got here, to Santiago from Mendoza, I found everything a bit
chaotic. But, looking backwards, it could not be different after coming from a much
smaller city. Chile is an awesome country and I will be coming back soon. I am lucky
to have been able to do everything I wanted to do and see in Santiago. I might have
missed some things around Valparaiso and Viña del Mar, but I am very happy with
this trip. Tomorrow, it's time to go back home and start planning the next one!
