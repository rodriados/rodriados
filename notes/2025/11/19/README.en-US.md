When I was planning this trip, I honestly did not expect to like this city so much.
For everything that I researched about it, almost the only thing that would show
up were about vineyards - which honestly, I had no interest to see. Mendoza is much
more than vineyards and has much more to see and do. Today, we've driven to Mount
Aconcagua, the highest mountain in both the western and southern hemispheres. It
was an incredible experience, the drive there has lots to see in the way. The only
thing that I wanted to see and could not was the Christ statue that was put on the
peak of the mountain in the border between Argentina and Chile. If I have the chance,
I will surely come back here in the future.
