Today, after 5 or so years, we are back to the farmstead we have bought back in
2019. It was a long wait and a hard fight, but we are finally back to what belong
us. The issue is not totally over yet, as the justice system has virtually infinite
steps and ways to prolong things to be over. Fortunately, the house and land there
wasn't too bad. Okay, it was dirty, and we have a lot of things to clean up but
in general it is all in good conditions. We now hope that we can, finally, have
some return on the investment we have made.
