After a bit more than 3 years working at the same company, I've got an offer to
move to work elsewhere. But, I am deciding to stay. I like it where I am and, although
I understand that the situation might change a bit in the future, there's not much
reason for me to leave right now. The offer is good, it's not easy to say no to
it but, economically, it might not make much sense the way that it is right now.
The only advantage would come, maybe, in around a year. By then, I believe I might
get a promotion or an even better offer. Not an easy decision at all.
