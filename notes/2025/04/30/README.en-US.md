Although I - technically - have been in São Paulo many times in my life, I have
never come here to see the city and its touristic attractions. The city has a lot
of history but also has definitely grown too much and too fast. This is no news
to me, but there are nice places to see and there are some that are ugly. Walking
in downtown São Paulo seems, at times, to be immersed in the complete chaos: too
many people, too many cars, a lot happening at the same time. Yeah, the typical
"big city smell" is present as well. It's a nice experience to be here, but it hasn't
changed my mind about moving and living here: I'd rather not.
