My brothers and I finished 2025 anxiously waiting for the ending of this series
that we have been watching for some years now, Stranger Things, on Netflix. After
years of waiting, the show's final season has finally premiered in December and
we finished the year and started 2026 watching its final episode. That was the last
thing we did in 2025 and the first one we did in 2026. So anxious we were to see
how the story would end. Sadly, we were kinda disappointed by how it ended. Maybe
we should not have expected more.
