I never thought I would never come to this city. Actually, I could even say that
for the longest time, I didn't even know it existed, but I liked it here. I had
the chance to officially visit Paraguay yesterday and today I went to some jesuitic
ruins that were interesting, to say the least. The historic part of it was the most
interesting, and I have learned some things that do contradict what I have learned
back then in school. It is such an important story of our continent's colonization
that it would be very interesting that more people knew about it. Tomorrow I'm leaving
Posadas to go to Puerto Iguazú, but I already miss it here. Also, I thought I would
not like to stay alone here, but it was definitely one of the best things here.
