Today I saw the second most expected thing of this whole trip: the Itaipú Dam! It
was for long the biggest dam in the world and still is the hydroelectric plant with
the highest output of energy on Earth. It is an impressive engineering achievement
to build such a humongous structure to produce a ridiculous amount of energy. It
was great to see it up close and understand a little bit how it works, and see its
internal parts functioning, and feel the heat, the noises and all the shaking. I
understand absolutely nothing about electrical engineering, but it was really great
nonetheless.
