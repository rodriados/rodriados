This week I've been in Curitiba, as I arrived here from Foz do Iguaçu on Monday.
Initially, I was feeling a bit lonely as the hostel I stayed there in Foz do Iguaçu
had parties everyday and it was initially easier to talk to people. On Tuesday,
I've befriended a British and a Peruvian girls, with which I have seen the whole
city since then. Today they have left for Florianópolis while I go back home tomorrow.
Also, today I had the chance to see a family friend which I hadn't seen for years.
It was great seeing them again. In general, Curitiba is a great city, it is really
developed and I leave wanting to come back one day.
