I originally planned to go see the Iguazú Falls today, but the bus from Posadas
took so so long to arrive that I decided to go there tomorrow. Instead, I walked
to triple border and took an hour-long boat ride through the Iguazú and Paraná rivers
that define the borders between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. It was a nice way
to enjoy this day even though the original plans couldn't be made. Puerto Iguazú
is a small but very touristy city, it seems pretty cool but really warm.
