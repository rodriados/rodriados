I finally saw the Iguazú Falls today! That was the sole reason I came here, definitely
the highest point of this trip, and it was completely worth it. I decided to see
both Argentinian and Brazilian sides in the same day, which might have been a crazy
decision. My feet and knees have been hurting since I was in Posadas already. I
didn't know the falls would wash us even being above them... It was awesome to feel
like being part of those waters. Uncomparable scenery and feeling to be there. Of
course, nothing was perfect: in the Brazilian side I had to carry my backpack with
me all the time, because apparently they didn't have any lockers left, but it was
not a problem in the end. I wish to go back and see them again one day.
