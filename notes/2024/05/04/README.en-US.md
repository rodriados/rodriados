Today I had the chance to race a kart. I've never done anything like it before,
and it was definitely a great experience. Granted, I finished last. We have run
for only 20 minutes, but it was enough for me to learn a lot about how hard it is
to race and how much physical strength one must have to do it continuously. Surely
it's not something we can afford to do everyday, nor do I currently have arms and
core strong enough to withstand the sheer forces when inside one of these cars,
but we will definitely do it again. At the beginning I was definitely scared, I've
put trust on the brake pedal, and would not let my foot go off of it. That's something
I must improve.
