# The year, 2024

I will remember the year of 2024 by the personal achievements that I've reached
and the experiences that I had during the 29th year of my life. Since January I
had planned this trip to Patagonia and I have spent almost the whole year expecting,
counting the days for it - it was like the day would never arrive. Well, it has
arrived and passed by already and it was an one-in-a-lifetime experience that I
wish to repeat in the future. That was definitely the most memorable point of the
year for me. In relation to my career, no significant changes.

In a broader spectrum, 2024 was an year of high-tension around the world. The imminent
threats of war we had by the beginning of the year have remained. Peace seems to
be at risk, but no effective action has been taken to initiate new conflicts. Let
that be some hope for better times in 2025.

Locally, we have had a tough year as well. As expected, we have started feeling
the consequences of the policies introduced the year before. I kept investing as
I have done for around 3 years now, but it was quite challenging as it require us
to have a strong mind to withstand and resist the urges that seeing your currency
devaluate causes. No better prospects for the new year in this regard.

But besides everything, 2024 was a year in which I have overcome fears and, that's
a purpose I wish the continue to follow going forward. Once again, I thank God for
all the things this year has presented to us. Let 2025 bring much more.
