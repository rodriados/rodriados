A new year has arrived and we make therewith plans and ideas for this new cycle.
For this year, I plan on starting going to the gym, eating healthier and becoming
more active in general. Also, I wish I can get to know people and, hopefully, find
a girlfriend and maybe (why not?) my future wife. I have to put on my mind that
I must start acting for my plans and wishes to come true. If I still keep on waiting
things to simply happen, I will never be able to achieve these goals. I will try
to force myself, at least during the start of this year, to do these things.
