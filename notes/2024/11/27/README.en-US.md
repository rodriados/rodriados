Today I witnessed a natural marvel that I never imagined I would ever see: the Perito
Moreno Glacier, in Los Glaciares National Park, here in Argentina. It's unfathomable
the size of this thing and how different this landscape is. I knew it would be one
of the highest points of my trip to the so-called "end of the world", but I could
never imagine how impressive it really is. I was truly surprised to find out that
you can hear thundering sound coming from the ice. It was an experience of a lifetime.
Tomorrow, we'll be going to Ushuaia, and I'm both happy and sad: happy to get to
know another increbible place but sad to leave the friends I've made in El Calafate
behind. We had the chance to stay in the place of a lovely argentinian couple -
Sandra and Fernando. They treated us with the utmost courtesy and developed very
good bonds in these few days. We will surely miss them for the rest of our adventure.
