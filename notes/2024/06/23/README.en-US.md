I've wanted to have a relationship with someone lately. I've met this girl with
whom I've been going out these last weeks and she's quite nice. Still, I think I
have too many filters and conditions and I honestly do not think it will ever evolve
to something serious, but only casual. That's definitely not what I ultimately look
forward to, but as long as both are aligned with the expectations, I do not see
it as something bad. Let's see to where it leads us.
