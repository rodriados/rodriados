### 11:02 UTC-03

Today is my last whole day in "the end of the world". There's kind of a magical
feeling being in this city. It is extremely beautiful, it is cold and definitely
incomparable to any other place I have ever been. Besides all the beauty we have
seen around the whole region, one of the things that I was most curious to experience
was how late the sun sets: it is weird - to say the least. My mind is definitely
not used to see bright skies at 10pm. I can't say I have really enjoyed it, but
it does allow for more things to be done in a single day. Tomorrow, we will leave
Ushuaia behind heading to Chile - which I have never been "officially" before. Although
we are anxious to know this new place, it also reminds us that our trip is getting
to its end.
