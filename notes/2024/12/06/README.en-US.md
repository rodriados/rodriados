I'm coming home, home to roost. **Tonight I'm coming to love you.** - Big Black Delta.

Today I had the chance to see the incredible Torres del Paine National Park, here
in South Chile. It is truly one of the natural marvels of the world and totally
worth it the time and distance to get there. The day was marvelous, sky was blue
as it can get and it was hot: I even had to take my jacket off. It was a high point
to end this adventure in this side of the world, as tomorrow we will be going back
home. The feeling I have is that I must come back in the future. There was just
a lot more to see in the region around Punta Arenas that I could not see. At least
it serves as an excuse to come here once again in the future.
