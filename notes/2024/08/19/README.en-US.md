I have to admit that I've been very lazy to write my daily notes. When I started
this project some years ago, the idea was that I would write all my thoughts and
ideas down, as some kind of storage of everything that's gone through my mind and
that I've learned. Well, I knew from the get-go that I would not keep doing it for
long, specially because it's a bit difficult to write these notes. Still, it surprises
me that at least I write it now and then. I have not yet deleted it all, as I thought
I would at the beginning.
