Although I can only go on vacation after August, I've been already planning what
or where I want to go next. Currently, my idea is going to the so-called "end of
the world". It is actually much closer than one might imagine: Argentina and Chile.
If everything works out, in November I'll start my journey in El Calafate and El
Chalt√©n, to see the glaciers and patagonian mountains very closely, then I'll head
to Ushuaia and maybe, if my plans work out, Punta Arenas in Chile. These last days
I've been quite anxious about, wishing that time went by as fast as possible so
I can make these plans real.
