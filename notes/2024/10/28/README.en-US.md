I cannot believe we're almost in November already... I had planned this trip to
Patagonia since the January and I have since then kept in my mind that there was
a lot of time for us to go there. Well, now it's already less than a month and I'm
really looking forward to it. There are still some details to take care of, but
I think this will be one of the best trips of my life. I wish the weather will be
great during my time there, but I'll make the best of it anyways. I expect to see
a different side of Argentina in relation to that that I've seen last year.
