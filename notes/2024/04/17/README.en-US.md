For the first time in nearly or around 40 years, Iran has attacked Israel and that's
what everyone is talking about all the time. I wish we didn't have to worry so much
about wars in this century, given all the history we've known from the past. But
I'm not an idealist, nor do I cherish utopic ideals - I know the world we'll always
be in crisis, like a cycle that is ever repeating itself. I've been trying to set
my mind away from these problems that seem to be so far from us, but I guess it's
not possible in this era of quickly-spreading information: you'll get to know it
whether you like it or not.

I do not use to get accomodated in a position that might be somewhat good for my
career or my future. I do have plans and surely would like to make them come true.
With that in mind, I must be very grateful to all the blessings I have had in my
life but specially in the recent years. Currently, I am really happy with the job
I have: it allows me develop myself professionally as well as offers me a great
salary that possibilitates me to build wealth and have a comfortable life. I must
not forget to keep seeking and pushing forward to reach my life goals.
