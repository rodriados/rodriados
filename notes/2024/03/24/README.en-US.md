I don't usually think about geopolitics or whatever is happening with the world
in general. But, unfortunately, things seem to be heading to a worrisome direction
these last times. There are some signs of some people trying to fight back the ideologies
that will take the Western world to its demise, if not the whole world. Sometimes,
the future seems to be very bleak, nonetheless I'm very grateful to all the good
that I have in my life, and the opportunities that are always knocking at my door.
It's sad to think about what can happen, but we have to be always hopeful.
