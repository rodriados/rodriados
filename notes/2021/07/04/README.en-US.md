More than a month after my last daily personal notes, I'll be once again trying
to develop this habit. Last month, June 2021, I had in the first weeks a very bland
case of dengue. At the beginning I though it could be side effects of the flu vaccine
I had a day before the symptoms arise. Also, this month I started on my new job.
At first everything was chill, and I still have expectations on how this new cycle
of my life might evolve.
