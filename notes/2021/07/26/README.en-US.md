Since I was a little kid have the Olympic Games amazed me. I can still remember
pretty well the first time I watched an olympic competition, in Athens 2004. Honestly,
I couldn't really understand what was going on, but I cheered for my fellow countrymen
which did manage to get a medal at the Men's Marathon. Then, through all these years
I have yearned and watched every edition as much as I could, even though I'm not
really into watching sports of any sorts.
