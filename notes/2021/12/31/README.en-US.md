Finally, the last day of the year is here. The end of the year use to be a time
in which people reflect over the difficulties they endured and the achievements
they reached in the year that's ending. When I was a child, I used to suffer the
end-of-year blues when the festivities were gone and a whole new year begun - so
many were the moments left behind that became memories in the last 12 months, I
thought. Nowadays, I don't really care much about the end of a year, which also
makes me a bit sad. Nonetheless, I am now able to look back and recall all my personal
achievements. Sometimes it might be quite hard, but new cycles will always begin,
and let 2022 come!
