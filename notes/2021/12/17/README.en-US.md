Times to times I'm impressed with the fragility of systems that are important and
have great social and economic value. Around a week ago, a breach that has been
found in a package for _logging_ in Java scares the world: considered one of the
greatest vulnerabilities to date, the package _log4j_ allows an attacker to easily
take control of a victim machine, opening the doors wide for every kind of damage
that can harm a computational system. Due to the sheer extension of the failure,
it is believed not to be possible to evaluate how many and which systems are vulnerable
around the globe. It is flabbergasting to know that the whole internet is only one
_open-source_ package away from its total collapse.
