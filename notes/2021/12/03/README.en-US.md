I find it incredible to have the experience and the opportunity to get to meet and
know people from various different regions. Sometimes during my life I had this
opportunity, and today is one of them. For an in-loco event of the company I work
for, the first one after the pandemic, a person from each Brazilian state the company
have workers on has been selected to come to São Paulo and take part of a party
for the end of the year. I use to value a lot these occasions to get to know different
cultures and show, too, something that is characteristic of the region I live in.
Never have I ever had a bad experience in occasions such as these.
