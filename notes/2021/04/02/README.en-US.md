I'm no vegetarian, but I confess that I do not like it when there's only meat to
eat for lunch or dinner. I understand that this might be some kind of complain of
someone who does have the privilege to chose what to eat, but I don't understand
why someone would choose to only eat something fat, that is maybe not really healthy,
and not so tasty either. Please understand, I do eat meat, but I find it weird when
there's only meat and nothing more. Why eat only meat when there are some many other
things that would make a better meal?
