I really should make the effort to write my thoughts daily. I should log whatever
passes through my mind to keep it registered. I'm completely forgetting about it,
and I must force myself to acquire this habit.

I confess that I dream of living abroad, out of my country. Although I have already
had the opportunity to live this unique experience for a year a while ago, the possibility
of it coming true does give me goosebumps. Because though I want it, moving abroad
will never be an easy task nor one without great risks. But if we keep on thinking
about the risks, we will never evolve in our
lives.
