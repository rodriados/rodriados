I believe we should always keep ourselves open to new opportunities. Even if you
find yourself happy in a place at the moment, opportunities can bring you new challenges
that may present you different perspectives to those you were planning to take.
Furthermore, the doubt between staying at a good place and risking to go to a potencially
better one is good. We should not accommodate ourselves while we still have the
privilege to risk it. That's a mindset I've been applying to my life recently.
