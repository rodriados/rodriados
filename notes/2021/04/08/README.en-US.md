I had been learning a bit about the swedish language in these last days. It has
fascinated me about how easy verbs in this language work. In a nutshell, verbs are
not conjugated in relation to person or number, so they are even easier than English.
In relation to vocabulary, I could realize that it is more similar to Icelandic
than German. And I could see it even though my knowledge about Icelandic is very
small.
