Once again I'm making an effort to learn Category Theory, in order to be able to
use the power it provides in some functional programming patterns. Even though it
all seems to make sense, and they do, it is sometimes hard to visualize how these
patterns could be used to solve some common problems. I'm thinking about developing
some kind of tool, framework or software in Haskell to test my knowledge. Within
the concepts I've been studying, _Lens_ and _Arrow_ are among them, and although
simple in their definitions, they are apparently very useful in some situations.
