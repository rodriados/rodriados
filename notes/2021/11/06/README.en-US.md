It's been quite a while that I keep in my mind the idea of opening my own business,
a technology start-up, if possible. I've already talked about it with many people,
but I'm still lacking the idea. I need answers for the questions: what is the problem
I'm able tackle? What could be done in order to ease people's lives and that they
would pay for? I've been looking a lot into entrepreneurship lately and, the more
I see, the more I realize that it's not easy to create something that really brings
value into a person's life.
