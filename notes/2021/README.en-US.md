# The year, 2021

Almir Sater: Each one of us compose our own history, and each being carries within
the gift to be capable, **to be happy**.

Of the hopes and wishes from the beginning of the year, the one shared by the whole
world has not come true. For the second consecutive year, the pandemic marked 2021
and was, undoubtedly, the most commented subject throughout the year. Despite the
effects felt by my country e by society in general, 2021 has brought me many positive
personal achievements.

In 2021, after significative doses of stress in previous years, I have finally graduated
and got my Masters in Computer Science degree. I had the opportunity to present
the work we have developed in an international conference, and we have even received
a prize for being one of the best papers in the event.

In june I have changed jobs, which has given me a better life quality and a significative
wage raise. This, in its turn, helped me financing my own apartment, which I can
keep rented while I do not need to live in it. Also, I had the opportunity to travel
to SÃ£o Paulo and meet some colegues, of this new job, in person.

Despite all the problems and barriers we had to endure throughtout the year, I must
thank God for everything 2021 represented in my life.
