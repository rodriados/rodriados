I really do not like cold days. I always prefer hot weather instead of cold ones.
The cold bothers me, disturbes me, deconcentrates me. It looks like it is always
making itself felt, and you feel it with every movement of your body. I do understand
that extreme hot is no good either, but it is much easier to get rid of the hot
than it is of the cold.
