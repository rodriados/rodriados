### 00:30 UTC-04

After a tedious weekend, in which I haven't done anything I should have done, it's
monday once again. I could have finished this work long time ago already, but there's
something that makes me want to work on something else everytime.

### 19:36 UTC-04

Sometimes I get happy when I realize that my master's degree is almost finished.
I can't wait these weeks to go by, so that I can forget about the work I have to
do. Maybe that's what they call a "peaceful spirit".
