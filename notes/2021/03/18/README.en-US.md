Today I watched a video in which a pair of friends take a 24-hour trip in an iron
ore train, through the Sahara desert, totally isolated from any civilization. Even
though I like travelling, I don't think I would have the courage to take part of
such a trip. Although many people have to go through it, facing huge risks and great
difficulties simply to transport supplies for their daily lives, doing it for the
sole purpose of seeing nature in its purest forms would an one-in-a-lifetime experience.
At the very least, it would make us think about how comfortable our lives are for
having easy access to everything we routinely need.
