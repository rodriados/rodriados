Sometimes it's hard to believe there can be any chance for this country to get better,
it will not. Sometimes it's common to think that we have already reached the bottom.
Sometimes we surprise ourselves how there's always somehow things can yes worsen.
Sometimes I ask myself whether it's this country's justice that's really fair or
if I'm the one actually wrong. Sometimes it looks as things were following their
right course, to their correct conclusions, disillusion. Sometimes I forget that
the problems are not only up there, but they also reach us personally and directly.
Sometimes I think that it happens only to that one guy, it does not. Sometimes I
think there is hope to this country, maybe in 2022, there is not. Sometimes it's
hard to believe...
