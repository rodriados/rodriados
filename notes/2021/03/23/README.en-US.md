Today I found out that many languages will go extinct due to our modern lives, connected
to the internet. What I saw talked about the Icelandic language, which I do have
the interest to learn someday, and how children over there start using English to
communicate among themselves since an early age. The argument goes on to say that,
as the language has an extremely low number of speakers, the amount of content available
in their native language is also very low. Therefore, a more common language is
used instead. According to the statistics presented, only 5% of all languages on
Earth might survive the digital era. This, unfortunately, does make sense and it's
a pitty.
