Lately it's come to me the idea of starting to learn new languages, such as French
and Russian. Those who know me know that I like a lot to learn new languages and
to get know new stuff all the time. But first, I have to improve my German skills.
I must dedicate myself more to this language so I can soon have a good mastery 
level with it.
