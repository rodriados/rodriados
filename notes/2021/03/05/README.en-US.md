Today I discovered that we should not use *master* as the default branch of a git
repository, but *main*. I confess I really cannot understand the reasons to promote
such a change that will cause trouble to those that already use this tool. If this
word really has such a bad conotation, then why has it taken us decades to figure
it out? Does the usage of this word, by itself, really offend anyone? If one gets
offended by the name of a simple *branch*, then what will happen when the moment
of an unavoidable negative feedback comes? I really do not care about the word itself,
I just believe that such a change should only be made by strictly technical reasons.
