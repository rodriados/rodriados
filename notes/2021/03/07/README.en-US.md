Today I learning a little bit about the Riemman Hypothesis, how it came to be and
what it states. It's interesting how our mathematical knowledge, as a species, is
very limited in some fields. I would like to have the knowledge required to at least
understand what it would mean to us if someone could actully prove this hypothesis.
