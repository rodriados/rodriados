There's this saying, that supposedly has been mathematically proven to be true,
although I haven't really checked it, that says that every person on Earth is at
most 6 degrees of contact away to any other person on the planet. I was wondering
how long would this contact chain be to connect any two random persons in the city
I live in. That was quite an interesting mental exercise.
