Today a global outage has affected all Facebook services, including WhatsApp and
Instagram. It might look like some kind of joke or the purest of coincidences, but
what happened and what was reported in the press was exactly what I thought would
happed in such situation: chaos and despair for many people. Although I do understand
that many need these services to earn their money and keep their jobs, there also
are those that felt completely lost, not knowing what to do with their lives away
from these networks. Particularly, I was not affected in any sense during the 6
hours of outage. On top of that, only have I gotten to know about when the services
were down and back up again via the press that would not talk about anything else
today.
