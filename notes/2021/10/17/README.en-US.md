After a historic storm in my city, last Friday, we had a power outage for about
27 hours at home. Although, at the first look, it might look like there is nothing
good to take out of this, I feel like I could enjoy more the time for rest I had
during the weekend and, at the same time, notice the little things we can do in
our daily lives to let time pass by. No more electronics and screens, little to
no connection to the internet. Maybe I did need a bit of it.
