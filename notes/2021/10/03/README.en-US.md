### 23:30 UTC-04

I could very well work saturdays and sundays, without any kind of problems. My only
condition would be that I didn't need to wake up early. There are very little things
that I like less than waking up before the time I would naturally wake up. I do
understand that it might be easily explained by the fact that I am always going
to bed quite late, still, I feel like it is not easy to change such habit.
