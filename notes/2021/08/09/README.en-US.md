Since I was a kid, I always felt nostalgic whenever the Olympic Games were over.
During those two weeks, always have I wanted, and I admit that I still do, to know
everything about what's happening, cheering for my country's athletes so that they
become inspiration for future generations. I used to think how long it would take
us for those 4 years to pass by so that the Games were back. As I got older, though,
this has almost gone away. Not for not liking it anymore, but for learning that
time is too valuable for us to want it to go by fast.
