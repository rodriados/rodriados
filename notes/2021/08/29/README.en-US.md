Today I saw lists of top-hit songs of each month during the years, since the 70s
up to our current days. Wherewith, we can realise how much musical production has
evolved worldwide through this time. Although there are many that would argue that
music today is created using industrial processes, that every song has the same
rhythm underneath and that, in its great majority, they'll not be remembered to
the generations to come, and even though I partially agree with this idea, I must
also concede there still is good music today as of there was then. Maybe, the biggest
difference might be that, today, there's greater competition and musical diversity
is much wider.
