Leo Tolstoy: Nothing can make our life, or the lives of other people, more beautiful
**than perpetual kindness**.

I believe that we should seek and strive as much as possible for good communication
skills. Clear communication is essential to the development and upkeep of good personal
and professional relationships. Nevertheless, I feel that the given of good communication
has been evidently lacking in our society nowadays, making life and the coexistence
in a society harder in the contexts that such absence is critical.
