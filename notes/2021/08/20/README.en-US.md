Sometimes it is hard to believe how much evil mankind is able to do to its own species.
This week, the world watches, powerless, the takeover of the government of Afghanistan
by an extremist group that imposes rigid, obsolete and inappropriate laws to the
citizens of that country. Such cruelty extends to the search for signals of "western"
behaviour or beliefs, offenses whose penalty is death. Many are the ones trying
to flee, risking their lives, handing their children to foreigners in search of
hope that they might survive and live in peace.

It is hard to me to admit it, but programming in C# is very good, maybe even fun.
You don't have to worry about those small technical details, neither with irrelevant
things: just go and do it. I'm happy to be able to use such technology professionally,
specially after so much time dealing with lower-level languages such as PHP and
C++, which I honestly still fond very much.
