### 02:52 UTC-04

As this is a new experience to me, I have read the notes I'd written yesterday.
As expected, I've quickly found errors for maybe thinking faster than what I can
actually type. Although I've thought about fixing these errors, I decided to let
them be as they were originally written. It might as well already be the time I
leave my perfectionism behind and start tolerating the faults of what I create.
Not everything in our lives can we control, then let it be.

I've been quite interested in chess lately. I've been playing some games, watching
some videos and streams of people teaching some techniques. I used to play chess
with my father when I was younger, but I don't really know what made me become
interested in it again. I still miss lots of moves anyway.

I am once again thinking about how I could make it easier to add new notes. I've
always been used to do everything manually, but I also know that if took some time
to try to automatize some processes, in the end I would have a significant time
gain when doing these tasks.

I happened to be watching some advertisement that aired on TV during the 60's. It's
so interesting to have a look on how people lived and what they consumed by that
time, and how much humanity has changed and evolved since then. For younger generations
such as mine, I think it's really hard to imagine how life was like back then. I'm
so clueless that sometimes I forget people could actually see colors before we had
colors on TV.
