I just discovered that the Portuguese Language had, to some extent, influenced the
Afrikaans language, a variation of Dutch spoken in South Africa. I got curious to
know how this language came to be, given that, to my knowledge, South Africa had
been a british colony. I then discovered that it had also been a dutch colony before,
and that explains the origins of this language. Some of words commonly used by
its speakers have, apparently, come from Portuguese.

Sometimes I wonder whether people would be more productive if they started their
daily routines a bit later. I may be the only one who doesn't like waking up easly
but... I have no doubts everyone could do with a bit more of sleep.

It was always very clear to those that know me that I like a lot learning new languages.
I think language exchange is one of the best things I decided to do, some years 
ago already. Besides allowing me to be in contact with different cultures and people
from different countries, things that I like a lot, the exchange also helps a lot
the learning by promoting a frequent training with the language.
