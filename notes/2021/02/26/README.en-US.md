I'm always having a had time to write technical texts. I would rather always write
stories, narratives. I don't think I write well, but it looks as though I'm always
too descriptive or use too many adjectives. Fair enough, mathematics is a language
by itself, with unique symbols and meanings that are not that easy to get used to.
