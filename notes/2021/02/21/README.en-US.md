Always offer the best of yourself to others and **do not accept anything less than
the best from others to you.**

I might have lost too much time writing, fiddling with and tweaking my GitHub profile
welcome page. I could not accept the social network icons to be visible only when
the user had the light theme on. So I spent some time figuring out how I could make
these *damned* icons to work well on both the dark and light themes. Although the
page I built is quite simple, I am now satisfied with it. Simple and direct, that's
the way I like it.

I should be writing my master degree thesis this afternoon. Unfortunately, I don't
feel any motivation to do so. I know I have to have it done next week. I have worked
for so long on it, but I think it won't be of much value for my future sadly. Just
one last push, that's all I need to have it finished.

There are some songs that remind me of the past, even if I hadn't really heard them
often in the past. It looks like there are some rhythms that trigger a kind of
nostalgic state in me. I've known for a fact that some songs I listen to daily
do make me nostalgic sometimes. I guess my mind is always trying to correlate songs
with my feelings and memories... So much so that I can remember the context in which
I've come to know some songs I really fancy.
