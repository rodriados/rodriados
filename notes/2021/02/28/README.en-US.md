I've always been fascinated by the night sky. I was told that the first word I ever
said was "moon". Not only that, since an early age, I have always loved to learn
and know about everything related to astronomy. Whenever I look to the dark sky,
I feel a kind fear within me. It's a fear of the unknown, of the dark, the deep.
Not a fear to flee from, but whereof to know what hides behind the darkness, what 
can not be understood by our limited humanly minds.

I think it's impossible not get tired after working for hours and hours during a
weekend, practically without rest, on something you'd like it were done already.
I am glad to know that, by the end of this week, soon I will be able to concentrate
and work on other personal projects, that do not need to be ready by a date fixed
by someone other than me, or by external reasons.
