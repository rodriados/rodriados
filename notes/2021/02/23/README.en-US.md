Koos Kombuis: Die hele wêreld word stil, en luister in die donker uur na die naggeluide
van **Lisa se Klavier**.

It's very interesting how a song's musicality catches my attention even if I cannot
speak the language it is sung in. *Sigur Rós'* music was the sole factor that made
me want to learn Icelandic 11 years ago, even though this language wouldn't really
be useful to me.

### 21:25 UTC-04

I am once again focused and concentrated to finish my master thesis. After all this
time, I can finally feel the end is just around the corner. I can already imagine
being able to think about and work on other stuff next week. Until there, though,
focus and concentration are required.
