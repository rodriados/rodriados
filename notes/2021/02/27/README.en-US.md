There are times that I discover a song and then I listen to it repeatedly. This,
unfortunately, may cause this song to be stuck in head and consequently I may get
irritated with it. I am yet to discover something to free my mind when it's caught
by a catchy song. Although I may forget about it for a while, it always comes back
later in the day.
