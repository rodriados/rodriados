Harrison Ford: I wanted to live the life, a different life. **I didn't want to go
to the same place every day and see the same people and do the same job.** I wanted
interesting challenges.

Today I came across a personality test and decided to take it. To my surprise, the
result seemed to describe me almost perfectly. Apparently, my personality can be
categorized as [ISTP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/istp-personality), and,
amongst the characteristics of such personality are the desire to be always envolved
into new projects, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and
also the will to be always exploring new possibilities and spaces. Obviously, I
do not agree that the description of such personality is my perfect fit, but the
similarities are remarkable enough that it is worth sharing.
