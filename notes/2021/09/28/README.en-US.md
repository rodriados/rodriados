I am preparing myself to publish my first opinion here in this repository. The goal
with these documents is to register, in a more thorough and lengthy way, some of
the opinions I think that are worth it to share with the world. I understand that
opinions might be and are often controversial and that many have problems to deal
with opposing lines of thought. For that reason, I would not be that surprised to
get any kind of feedback for any of the opinions I write in the future.

I admit I have problems giving people feedbacks, specially those about bad things.
This is probably because I never really know what are the struggles people are going
through at that moment and how it might affect them, or because I really am not
able to be observant of the bad side of things. I do recognize, though, that only
with feedbacks we can try improving someone or something.
