The Divine Comedy: Tonight we fly over the chimney tops, skylights and slates, looking
into all your lives and wondering why **happiness is so hard to find**.

Yesterday I have taken my second vaccine dosis for Covid-19. Fortunately, the number
of cases and deaths in my country are finally going down and it seems it will not
be up that much again. Therefore, with my second shot taken, I hope that life can
finally go back to somewhat normal, as it was before the pandemic. Controversially,
many people have said and believe that our lives will never be as it was before.
Besides those that unfortunately have passed away, I beg to differ: I believe that,
as soon as the restraints the pandemic has put on us are gone, the great majority
of people will go back to the lives they had before. A clear example is working
from home: as soon as it was possible to go back to office again, many companies
have forced their employees to do so.
