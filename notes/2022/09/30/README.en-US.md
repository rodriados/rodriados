This weekend, unfortunately, there will be elections in my country. There's not
a single candidate I would happily vote for. Sometimes I think only the worst ones
are allowed to run for presidency. I cannot foresee a different scenario for the
future 4 years than more instability. It looks as though instability and stagnation
are what this country is always striving for. No steps forwards, let us rather look
on our past mistakes and repeat them.
