Some weeks ago I have met this girl I had already gone out with sometimes. She has
many of the points I look for in a girl: she is pretty and she likes engineering.
The problem, maybe, is that I cling on to people way too quickly and, sometimes,
due to our jobs, we do not have enough time to see each other. I admit that this
bothers me sometimes, as I consider myself as someone who enjoys to physically be
with the people I like.
