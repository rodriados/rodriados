After some weeks learning about the financial and stock markets, and investments
in general, I wish I had started studying about this world much earlier. Even though
the present moment might be interesting to start investing, due to the challenging
national and international economic scenarios, I believe I could have already reached
part of my objectives, should I have started some years ago. Anyways, it's better
start late than never.
