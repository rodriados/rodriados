I've been studying about the financial market, about stocks, real estate and investment
funds. I'm planning on starting to invest and build a patrimony from which I can
receive, in the future, dividends and passive income. I consider myself a conservative
investor and I want, therefore, start with little but invest more each month. My
studies have been very interesting and I have learned a lot in a short time about
this universe. I know there is still lots to learn so that I can take correct and
assertive decisions, but I believe I'm on the right path. The financial market is
truly fascinating.
