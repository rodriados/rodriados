Today I woke up at 5h30 in the morning. It was not planned, but it was good to see
the Sun rise and see the capital of the country waking up. This city, by the way,
looks a bit weird to me. It is not organic, it is not natural, everything seems
to be too big and has a unique architecture that cannot be found anywhere else.
Still, I was always fascinated by the power that emanates from the country's center
to the nation's farthermost corners. Brasília is peculiar but certainly beautiful.
