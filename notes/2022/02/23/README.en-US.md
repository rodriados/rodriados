After many decades of relative peace, the longest period of peace in Europe's history,
a war is likely to start as Russia decided to invade Ukraine. Honestly, the geopolitical
situation of the region is quite complicated, but there is no justification for
a war in the 21st century. My hopes at this moment is that this situation gets solved
as soon as possible in order to avoid greater damage.
