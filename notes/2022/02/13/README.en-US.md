I've been watching the Winter Olympics. Sometimes I wish I had the chance to at
least once practice some of those sports, such as ice-skating and curling. I'm sure
that, at first, it would be even difficult to be standing on the ice without falling.
That's worth a try nonetheless. Unfortunately, though, as someone who lives on the
tropics, I do not have an easily accessible ice rink to spend some time on.
