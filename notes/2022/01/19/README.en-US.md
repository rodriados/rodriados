It looks like we're now in the _I-have-already-lost-count_-th wave of the pandemic.
Whenever we think the suffering of the past two years is finally becoming part of
past, a new wave of infections comes through and strikes us all over again. And
that's not something local: the number of infections are breaking daily records

the previous ones, it looks like it is capable of spreading much more quickly. By
