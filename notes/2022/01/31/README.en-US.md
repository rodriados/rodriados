We're already in the last day of the first month of the year. January brings with
it a lot of expectations and ideas of change in its beginning, but usually ends
with many of these already forgotten. Personally, January is also the month of my
birthday. After a certain age, I cannot care less with birthdays, on the contraire:
I usually despise them. Although many say that we should be thankful for one more
year, I cannot see it that way anymore. Nonetheless, I am happy for the end of one
more January.
