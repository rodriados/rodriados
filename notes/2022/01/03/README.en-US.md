The first days of a new year always give me the sensation that there is a possibility
to change bad habits. It is as if they were a stimulus or a reason to do so. This
is also the time of the year that we usually project and trace objectives we would
like to achieve the next months. Although, particularly, I have never fulfilled
my new-year objectives, I always have new hopes to do so whenever a new cycle begins.
Maybe that is too part of the cycle of a year.
