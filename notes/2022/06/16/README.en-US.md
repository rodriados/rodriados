This week I am preparing myself to, once again, take a new challenge in my professional
life. This time, a dream I used to have will come true: work at Amazon. It is always
complicated to say goodbye to the environment and the people we are already used
to work with to take on the risk of working for another company. At least this time,
I will have vacations for one month, and therefore I will have time to rest and
prepare myself to the new challenges.
