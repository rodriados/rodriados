### 18:00 UTC-04

Tomorrow is the last day I work at my current job. Though differently from the others
I had in the past years, this one is easiest for me to leave. Not because I didn't
have a good time there, I had, but because I didn't have the opportunity to create
personal bonds and relationships strong enough to make me feel as if I were missing
someone I really liked to be with. Also, the idea of being on vacation and have
some time off work really pleases me.
