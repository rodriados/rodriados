Even though I am already more than three months in my current job, I feel like I
still am not able to perform in all of my potential. I believe this is greatly due
to the fact that I must learn and adapt to tools that were developed in-house and
that are not available to the external public. Nonetheless, I think I must put a
greater effort so that I can reach all my potential as early as possible.
