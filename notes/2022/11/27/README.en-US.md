This month of November we're living the World Cup. I've always liked the mood of
this competition, even though it is a bit weird this time. I remind of when I was
still young and I would see the cars garnished everywhere with the national flag,
and the people had a different mood from what it usually is, with a hope for happiness
that's sometimes rare around here. It's been 20 years already since my country's
won the competition for the last time, but this time the expectations are higher.
It's something the whole country is hoping to enjoy next month.
