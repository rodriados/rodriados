# The year, 2022

After two consecutive years of abnormality, the year 2022 seemed to bring the world
back to what it was before. Well, at least when talking about the pandemic which
started back in 2020. Nonetheless, the year also presented surprises and made us
all experience things that were not seen in decades. Still, I had many positive
things coming to my personal life.

Once again, as it happened the previous years, I have changed jobs. Now, I have
the chance to work for a company I have long wanted to work for before. Besides
the financial evolution, I have the opportunity to learn and work with one of the
biggest companies in the world: a truly one-of-a-kind experience. Also, I finally
had the chance to see the city of Rio de Janeiro, which I had never been to before,
making it one of my best memories of the year.

Unfortunately, not all went well in 2022. In relation to the country I live in,
2022 ends with a lot of uncertainties for the future year. Though we want things
to progress and get better, our hopes as the year ends are low.

My 27th year has now gone by, and I, as always, must thank God for all the good
things I have been constantly living. In general, I believe I will remember fondly
of 2022 and hope the next year to be better.
