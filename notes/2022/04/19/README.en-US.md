Lately I am having the will to develop something that brings real value to someone's
life. I've been discussing some ideas about applications or services in general
that we could offer and, maybe, start a great business out of it. I believe I do
have the will to become an entrepreneur, but I may still be lacking the corage and
the time to really focus on the idea and bring it to life.
