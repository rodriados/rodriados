I always had the goal, maybe the dream, of opening my own technology business. Sometimes
I have the impression that nowadays there really are no more innovative or new ideas,
only better or worse implementations. Today, once more, we were discussing about
ideas we could really invest on, about business models that we could create. A true
brainstorming session. Even though that is really what I want to do, sometimes I
get doubts about how we can even start to make it come true.
