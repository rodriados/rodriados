It's been quite difficult lately for me to invest time in my personal projects.
I have not been writing my daily notes as I intended this to be. Maybe I have not
really convinced myself that these notes are actually in any way relevant or minimally
important to document my own life. I come here to write a note once or twice a month
just to say I have been doing it even though I really have not. I do not believe
I'll be changing my ways, but I hope I can keep doing it for as long as I can.
