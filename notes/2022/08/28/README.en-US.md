This weekend I had the opportunity to mount my table with adjustable height. I've
seen some people talking about it and I thought it would be an awesome idea to have
one of these. So far, my experience is the best I could possibly have. I'm really
happy with my purchase and the possibility to work standing in front of the computer.
I hope this also help me have a healthier work life and that I don't feel sleepy
as I do sometimes when working.
