So fragile is the human life. Even though we are always looking for the happy moments,
our lives are also composed by the sad and bad ones, the regrets and wishes that
we could have done something differently. Today is one the days that I must experience
sadness and get a bad news: one of the persons that was the most present in my life,
that saw my brothers and I grow up, that taught us a lot, and that we knew that
truly wished us the best at every moment, as if we were her own sons, unfortunately,
has no more hope of living by the doctors. We grew up calling her by her nickname,
simply "DÃª". When we were young, we would see her more often than our own mother
during the week: she dressed us, she bathed us, she cooked and gave us food without
any acknowledgement and, sometimes, with complaints. When we realize it, we don't
even time for thanking those persons that were really important on our lives anymore:
this is the lesson life keeps teaching us and that we insist on never learning.
