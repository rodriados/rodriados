The horrors of the war have been back to Europe in the last 10 days. It has taken
over the news outlets of the whole world: Russia has invaded Ukraine. Not only so,
Russia's president has been threatening the planet with increasingly higher dangers
such as preparing its nuclear bombs and shooting in nuclear power plants. It looks
as if the rest of the world could not do anything to stop his maddening will, that's
been shattering international relations and splitting the planet into two opposing
poles, once again, as it was during the Cold War. The scenes of the crimes committed
in ukranian terrority comes and piles up day after day. The world has not seen such
a serious threat to the planet's security since before I was born. The questions
that arise are "when and how is it all going to end up?" The answer seems to get
worse by the hour.
