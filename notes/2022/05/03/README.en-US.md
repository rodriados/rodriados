I was talking to some work colleagues, during the weekly meeting we have to practice
speaking the English language, and we ended up talking about workers unions. In
my mind, I confess, I have never had good experiences with unions. I have the impression
that, at least in this country, these institutions say to defend the workers they
represent but they actually do whatever they can to serve their prefered polititians.
I usually do not have this kind of feeling but due to some facts that happened in
my professional environment last week, relative to a trade union that supposedly
should "fight" for my work category, I spent around 3 days feeling angry and offended.
I think I should write my opinion about it to let it out.
