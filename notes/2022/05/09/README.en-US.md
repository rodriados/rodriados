Tonight I had the idea of creating a universal encyclopedia for languages, and for
some reason, that idea should use graphs. It's still just a vague idea, but I think
it all revolves around creating relationships between words, idiomatic expressions,
and even whole languages. For instance: a word could have a relationship to its
opposite, to its translation in another language, to false cognates in different
languages and so on. It's as if it were a logical description of human languages.
