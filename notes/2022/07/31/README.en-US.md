### 21:12 UTC-04

This is the last day of my first ever vacations. Tomorrow I begin, once again, in
a new job. This time, in a job I have dreamt of for a while early on my carreer.
I wish I had done more of my free time this month. There's a lot I wanted to do
that I simply wasn't able to do. Still, I do not feel frustrated about it, because
I think I have had the time to relax and rest for this environment I'll be working
on.
