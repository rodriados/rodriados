For the first time in my life I am having the opportunity to see the city of Rio
de Janeiro, which is the most famous place of my country worldwide. And, by doing
so, I get this feeling of being in a different country: everything seems so foreign,
so different from what I'm used to what this country looks like. Mountains everywhere,
beaches all around the city, the history contained within this city, all of this
amazes me.
