Whenever one of these competitions that happen only once every 4 years ends, such
as the Olympic games and the World Cup, I end up thinking about the age I will have
or how my life will be when the next edition comes by. So much so that when I was
younger I would even feel sad that it's over. Fortunately, nowadays, I have realized
that there's no point on thinking way on the future when we should enjoy every day
of our lives instead. Nonetheless, I still make projections about how I hope will
be in the future.
