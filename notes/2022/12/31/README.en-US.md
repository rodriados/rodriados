Today is the last day of the year. I don't know why, but every year I get the same
nostalgic or kind of sad feeling on the last day. As if my mind would recall or
remember all that happened this year. Even though it's just a day like every other,
we usually mark years as cycles, within which things end and start anew. Unfortunately,
the expectations for the coming year are currently not great. I hope things go better
than what we are now anticipating.
