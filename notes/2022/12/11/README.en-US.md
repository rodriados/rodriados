Even though the spirit in Brazil changes during World Cup times, it was different
this year. Unfortunately, we have lost once again in the quarter-finals. It's the
fourth time it happens since I started understanding what it all means. Somehow
this time I didn't feel sad at all. My life has changed so much in these last years
that I started caring more about things that are more important than a sports event.
Of course that I wanted my country to win, but it seems as if I don't care much
about it anymore. Well, let's try again in 4 years.
