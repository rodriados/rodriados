# Personal Log and Notes

This is where my mind and thoughts manifest, undoctored, ideally unfiltered.
Consider it the purest pieces of a consciousness that wants to keep its own
ideas, experiences and daily learnings somewhere safe, in a place they won't
be disturbed, in a place they won't be forgotten. Please, do not expect any
well-written or really relevant documents in these logs nor judge me for my
momentary personal opinions. Be warned that absolutely nothing here represents
anyone or anything other than my own self at a given context or point of my life.

As a perfectionist, I know I will certainly not keep up with the promise of
unedited and unfiltered logs of my own mind. I may strongly try not to, but
a complete refactoring of these files is foreseeable and even *highly*
likely. The very existence of these logs is not guaranteed for long.

Finally, I apologize for eventual spelling and grammar errors.
