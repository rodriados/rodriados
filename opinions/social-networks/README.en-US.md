# The Problem with Social Networks

The concept of social networks, since the appearance of the pioneers, was always
based on the capability of creating or strengthening ties between real people through
the internet. Though quite simple, this idea revolutionized society by connecting
and bringing together and shotening distances to friends, relatives or complete
strangers all around the globe. But, what at first was in general limited to text
messaging platforms, nowadays offers an extensive, exhaustive and ever-growing list
of resources tailored to capture human minds through addiction.

The quick expansion, widespread popularization and democratization of global internet
access, combined with the boom in mobile devices, sowed a fertile environment for
the exponential growth of such services. These have quickly become multinational
corporations whose greatest assets are human attention and the all personal information
they can gather. Thus, they record astronomical profits from the unproductivity
and lack of privacy of their users.

### "You never let go of that phone!"

Due to the lure of the constant flow of news and information at all times about
everything that happens in the world at hand, not rare are the occasions in which
individuals prefer the company of their screens to that of someone by their side.
It is not the first time that a social phenomenon this these characteristics has
been described: similar reports were common when books and television were not yet
accessible to all families. Nevertheless, the extent of what is currently observed
is impressive.

Albeit seemingly superficial and harmless, the consequences of this behavior, when
extrapolated, are often bad. It might serve as demonstration the existence of public
campaigns so that drivers and bikers do not split their attention between the handling
of their vehicles and their phones, which effectively increases the rate of traffic-related
incidents.

Others, at the same time, oblivious to any concerns about their own privacy, willingly
publish every private aspect of their lives, by continuously sharing updates of
their location or activities. The amount of information generated therewith becomes
quickly unmanageable, enabling deliberate, decontextualized and unscrupulous use
by third parties to cause harm.

### "You cannot think different from me!"

However, in my point of view, the worst brought by social networks to the society
is maybe the capacity of their members to filter and choose whom, and consequently
what, they wish to be exposed to. This ability, apparently positive, promotes the
grouping of individuals around common interests, nurturing social bubbles where
every sort of belief can be cherished and strenghtened incontested, sheltered from
the threats of opposing world-views. Such confirmation bias is incited directly
by the platform, which tries to display only information that align to the pre-existing
convictions of its users.

Characterized by quick and unimportant interactions, the nature of a virtual environment
is not very conductive to thorough, well-thought and articulated arguing. This,
in addition to the feeling of belonging to a majoritarian group, perhaps an unanimity,
evokes fervorous clashes when different ideals eventually meet up. The rejection
and unfamiliarity with heterogeneous lines-of-thought lead to insipid, empty and
violent episodes of heated disputes, often watered down with name-calling and _ad
hominem_ arguments.

Even worse, from time to time influential personalities or groups decide to publicly
demonstrate disapproval or direct hostility toward an unsuspecting target, inducing
crowds to rejectable behavior, without any kind of prior personal evaluation and
commonly based on past, inaccurate or misinterpreted facts. Anyone who does not
comply to any minute detail of their opinions is vilified and raged against, impacting
in unpredictable ways those unable to deal with such attack.

In spite of the aforementioned problems, along with some others, it is clear that
social networks have, in general, brought benefits to our contemporary lives. Nonetheless,
vigilance is needed when using such powerful tools, in order to avoid significant
consequences from affecting our lives and the lives of others. â–
