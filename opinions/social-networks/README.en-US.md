# The Problem with Social Networks

When the first social networks came about, the whole concept behind them was always
based on a very broad and simple idea of allowing people to be somehow connected
to their friends and acquaintances, specially when far apart from each other. Though
since its early days this idea has been mostly implemented around some sort of chat
platform, it is nowadays accompanied by an ever-growing list of features tailored
to capture human minds by addiction.

The quick expansion, popularization and ease of internet access, as well as the
boom of devices such as smartphones all around the globe, sowed an environment of
exponential growth for social networks. These, in turn, have become big corporations
whose biggest assets are the time they can keep one distracted and every bit of
information they are able to extract from their users.

### "You never let go of that phone!"

In our current times, with the appeal of constant novelty in the form of an endless
stream of incommensurable quantities of texts, photos and videos, scenes of individuals
looking at and typing into their own screens rather than talking to someone by their
side are often seen. Although many had written similar and worrisome notes in the
past about books or television, when they were not yet common to every household,
the extent of the modern phenomenon is truly overwhelming.

Albeit seemingly irrelevant at a first glance, not seldomly are the consequences
of said addiction bad at best and life-changing at worst. Drivers and bikers, for
instance, are frequently sighted recklessly splitting attention between phones and
the handling of their vehicles, effectively increasing the rate of traffic-related
incidents.

Others, beyond any kind of privacy concerns, publicize every aspect of their lives
by sharing, either publicly or only with those they are virtually connected to,
continuous updates and checkpoints about their current location and activities,
as if they truly lived in a virtual society. The amount of information generated
therewith is unmanageable and unerasable, possibly inducing real-life outcomes,
since there is so much available to be decontextualized, unscrupulously manipulated
and actively used to cause harm.

### "People nowadays have more virtual than real friends!"

It is denotative that virtual societies would be comprised of virtual friendships
and every other sort of virtual social interactions between its members. Not only
so, but members themselves are also virtual, so much so that it might be impossible,
at times, to tell whether they are a trustworthy digital representation of a person,
a business or anything real at all. Therefore, neither should they be expected to
behave as such.

According to some anthropologists, we are able to nourish only a very limited amount
of meaningful relationships throughout our lives. It is natural, then, that most
friendships in our lifetime would fade out and be forgotten... had we not added
them up onto our social networks' accounts. For some, the concept of a friendship
has thereby turned into a flimsy interaction where acknowledging a person's existence
once in a while suffices, eventually spoiling potential long-lasting relations and
possibly sprouting loniless, despite the great number of "friends".

On another spectrum, there are those who use these means in order to actively gather
as many people - followers - as possible within their own communities, either to
satisfy a craving for attention, self-acceptance or superfluous popularity, or to
entertain or educate. Just like artists and public people in general, with exposure
and fame also comes influence, which in turn can be used for good, but may also
be exploited to impose one's own opinions and ideals, as authority, on the listening
and conforming crowd.

### "You're not allowed to think different from me!"

Social networks have notoriously granted their members the ability to choose and
filter what and who they want to be exposed to and have contact with. Notwithstanding
that such power appears harmless, individuals with common interests have readily
come together and grouped themselves into isolating bubbles, where their beliefs
can be safely appreciated and strengthened, sheltered from the threatening influences
of opposing worldviews. This tendency, known as confirmation bias, is stimulated
by the platforms themselves, which will only display information their users are
likely to agree with.

The inherent nature of a virtual environment, characterized by mostly quick and
unimportant interactions, is not very conducive to thorough, well-thought and articulated,
hence lengthy, arguing. Such scenario, in addition to everyone's belief of belonging
to a majoritarian group and the rejection and unfamiliarity with heterogeneous points
of view, leads to clashes with outsiders whenever they meet up, thus following episodes
of heated strifes filled with name calling and pointless, empty, violent, and _ad
verecundiam_ arguments.

Even worse are the occasions when one influential group or someone irradiates disapproval
or straight-up hostility towards an unsuspecting target. In such situations, virtual
mobs primarily modelled by herd behavior, without any kind of prior fair judgement
and oft based on misinterpretation or inaccurate facts, show up to storm, defame
and damage any person, group or company that do not abide by their opinions in the
smallest things. Unforeseeable impacts are brought to the minds of those unable
to deal with obloquy.

In spite of the aforementioned problems and the rapid spreading of fake news enabled
by them, it is noteworthy that social media, in general, have also brougt many benefits
to our contemporary lives. To name a few: it is now possible to instantly know about
what is happening around the world; and it is much easier to find and change jobs
as someone was then required to roam around handing out résumés to as many employers
as possible. Still, we must be careful when using such a powerful tool, to avoid
inflicting significant consequences to our lives and the lives of others. ■
