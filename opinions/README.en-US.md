# Opinions and Rants

I always advocate that everyone has the right to be entitled to their own ideas
and opinions about everything, regardless of whatever it is all about. I am one
that would never allow my thoughts to be outsourced to anyone, and that does not
care whether anything I have an opinion about is controversial or not. Nevertheless,
I do believe opinions can and should be debated about and might be changed with
well based and presented arguments.

Here are some of the opinions I dared to write down. Please note that any reader
might and should disagree with anything I've written here, and I would be glad to
hear politely written disagreements about it. These documents are allowed to be
changed, corrected and even completely removed with time.

Be warned that absolutely nothing here represents anyone or anything other than
my own self at a given context or point of my life.
